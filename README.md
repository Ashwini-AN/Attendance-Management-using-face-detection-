Attendance Management Using Face Recognition: Detailed Explanation

Project Goal

The goal of this project is to automate the process of attendance marking using real-time face recognition and emotion detection. By capturing faces through a live camera feed, the system identifies individuals and marks their attendance. Additionally, it analyzes emotions to classify individuals as attentive or inattentive, providing insights into classroom engagement.
